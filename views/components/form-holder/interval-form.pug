    p The more time you spend sitting each day and the longer those periods of sitting are - the worse off your cardiovascular system is. Breaking up sitting with short, light-intensity physical activity is a healthy way to interrupt your sitting and make your blood vessels a bit more “happy." The green color indicates the ideal frequency for interrupting your sitting, the yellow is a moderate interval (less preferable, but not bad) to interrupt your sitting, and the red is a longer interval between sitting interruptions that is less preferred than the green or yellow. With that being said, any interruption is better than none, so don’t be worried if you can’t take a break from sitting every 15 or 30 minutes; just do your best to use the music as a positive reminder to get some movement in and help out your amazing body as often as you can : )
